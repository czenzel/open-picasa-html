</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>
<p>
We do not store any information provided to the web pages. The values you provide for retrieving album information are specifically used for calls made by your browser directly to the social media provider. There is <strong>no</strong> go between proxy servers or methods storing any of your data on a server. 
</p>
<p>
We may store data on your computer in order to enhance your experience such as storing application keys to help you with not having to enter values every time you use this application. We use &quot;cookies&quot; to do so. By using this application you agree to the use of cookies.
</p>
<p>
This application is open source and experimental. We cannot guarantee that it will work forever, but we will try our best to make sure to update it to do so. We are not responsible for any misuse of this application or your use of this application. We are not responsible for any damages. You are using this application and we hold no responsibility for anything that occurs.
</p>
<p>
When using application keys please be advised of the privileges you grant that key. Even though keys are transmitted straight to the social media provider using SSL you must account for the privileges that might get intercepted by other people such as at a coffee shop. We are not responsible for over-granting privileges. The safest use is to grant read-only privileges, such as with an Explorer tool, to photographs and/or videos so no post-based requests are made with your application keys.
</p>
<p>
To the basics: You are using an experimental and/or release version of an open source application and we take no responsibility for damages or downtime. We try our best to help so please use our Bug Tracker for any help you might need.
