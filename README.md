Open Picasa HTML Generator

This will generate XHTML compliant code for web sites that can not use embedded or server side code to grab Picasa or Google Plus images into web pages to share with others on the Internet.

This has been tested with Wordpress.com blogs with the default theme. It will generate 2 column based XHTML image galleries.

Please credit back to my GitHub site when you use this code! Thanks!
