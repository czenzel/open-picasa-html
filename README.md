Photo Publisher
================

Original Description:

Publish your photos to any web site from Google Plus or Google Picasa Web Albums with a couple clicks of your mouse. HTML 5 and Client-Side AJAX based components allow you to access your albums and place them on your web site without taking extra hosting space. Why publish your photos to multiple places when you already have them on your Google Plus social media pages?

What's New:

We have changed the name to Photo Publisher! You can now use photographs from your Facebook or Google Plus Photo Albums (personal or page-based albums) and include them right in your web site! It is real easy!
