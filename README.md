Open Picasa HTML Generator

This will generate XHTML compliant code for web sites that can not use embedded or server side code to grab Picasa or Google Plus images into web pages to share with others on the Internet.

This has been tested with Wordpress.com blogs with the default theme. It will generate 2 column based XHTML image galleries.

Please credit back to my GitHub site when you use this code! Thanks!

To use this code on your own web site:

Before using this code on your own web site please contact me via Facebook to ask first. Asking before using is always appreciated. I don't want the code to be used for a lot of commercial items, but rather to benefit the community and to make sure my development is also supported. As in my Economics 104 class at Penn State there is "no such thing as a free lunch." I am a programmer, need to go to school, and also need to support my family.

Before using the code please message me by using the link below describing why and how you plan to use the code for approval.
